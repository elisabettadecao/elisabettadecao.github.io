I am a Research Fellow in Economics at the [Centre for Health Service Economics & Organisation](https://www.chseo.org.uk) of the University of Oxford, an Associate Member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), a Research Associate at the [Centre for the Study of African Economies](www.csae.ox.ac.uk) of the University of Oxford, and a [Dondena](http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it) (Center for Research and Social Dynamics) Research Affiliate at Bocconi University. From November 2017 I am visiting ISER, University of Essex.

My main research interests are in health, development and family economics. I am particularly interested in global health problems. My current work studies the determinants of childrenâ€™s health and development, the impact of early life shocks on later outcomes, and violence against women and children. I have also done some work on statistical modelling for infectious diseases and on the evaluation of vaccination programs. To investigate my research questions I use micro-data from across developed (mainly US and UK) and developing countries (mainly Africa).

My CV is [here](../CV_DeCaoNOV17.pdf).
