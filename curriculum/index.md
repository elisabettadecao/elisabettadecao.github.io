I am Senior Assistant Professor in Health Economics at the London School of Economics in the Department of Health Policy. I am also an Associate Member of MiSoC (University of Essex), a honorary member at the [Centre for Health Service Economics & Organisation](https://www.chseo.org.uk) of the University of Oxford, a Research Associate at the [Centre for the Study of African Economies](www.csae.ox.ac.uk) of the University of Oxford, and a [Dondena](http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it) (Center for Research and Social Dynamics) Research Affiliate at Bocconi University. 

My main research interests are in health, development and family economics. My current work studies the determinants of childrenâ€™s health outcomes, violence against women and children, and measurement problems. I have also done some work on statistical modelling for infectious diseases and on the evaluation of vaccination programs. To investigate my research questions I use economic modelling and different sources of data both from developed and developing countries: large cross-section and longitudinal surveys, hospital administrative data, and weather data.
