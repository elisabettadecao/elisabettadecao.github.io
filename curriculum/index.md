I am Assistant Professor in Health Economics at the London School of Economics in the Department of Health Policy. I am also [IZA Research Fellow](https://www.iza.org/people/fellows/6099/elisabetta-de-cao), an Associate Member of [MiSoC](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/misoc) at the University of Essex, and a [Dondena](http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it) (Center for Research and Social Dynamics) Research Affiliate at Bocconi University.

The main focus of my research is understanding the determinants and long-term consequences of **children’s health and wellbeing**. My work complements the existing economic research on early childhood development, by looking at what are the main biological and behavioural mechanisms through which a shock experienced while in-utero or in the first few years of life influences health and development later on. My current work investigates the main socio-economic drivers of **violence against children**, from child abuse or neglect to female genital cutting. I also study the causal effect of maternal health services improvements on intergenerational health outcomes, and the impact of air pollution on mortality and economic outcomes later in life. Finally, I am interested in the interplay between the **environment and genetic** in influencing **fertility behaviour**. At the early stage of my career I did some work on statistical modelling for infectious diseases and on the evaluation of vaccination programs. To investigate my research questions I use micro-data from across developed (mainly US and UK) and developing countries (mainly Africa).
