I am Assistant Professor in Health Economics at the London School of Economics in the Department of Health Policy. I am also an Associate Member of [MiSoC](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/misoc) at the University of Essex, a Research Associate at the Centre for the Study of African Economies of the University of Oxford, and a [Dondena](http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it) (Center for Research and Social Dynamics) Research Affiliate at Bocconi University.

My main research interests are in health, development and family economics. I am particularly interested in global health problems. My current work studies the determinants of childrenâ€™s health and development, the impact of early life shocks on later outcomes, and violence against women and children. I have also done some work on statistical modelling for infectious diseases and on the evaluation of vaccination programs. To investigate my research questions I use micro-data from across developed (mainly US and UK) and developing countries (mainly Africa).

My CV is [here](../CV_DeCaoAPR18.pdf).
