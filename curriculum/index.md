I am Assistant Professor in Health Economics at the London School of Economics in the Department of Health Policy. I am also an Associate Member of [MiSoC](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/misoc) at the University of Essex, a Research Associate at the Centre for the Study of African Economies of the University of Oxford, and a [Dondena](http://www.dondena.unibocconi.it) (Center for Research and Social Dynamics) Research Affiliate at Bocconi University.

The main focus of my research is understanding the determinants and long-term consequences of **children’s health and wellbeing**. My work complements the existing economic research on early childhood development, by looking at what are the main biological and behavioural mechanisms through which a shock experienced while in-utero or in the first few years of life influences health and development later on. My work studies the causal effect of economic conditions, natural disasters, and randomised interventions on children’s health outcomes. I also investigate the main socio-economic drivers of **violence against children**, from child abuse or neglect to female genital cutting. Finally, I am interested in the interplay between the **environment and genetic** in influencing **fertility behaviour**. At the early stage of my career I did some work on statistical modelling for infectious diseases and on the evaluation of vaccination programs. To investigate my research questions I use micro-data from across developed (mainly US and UK) and developing countries (mainly Africa).
